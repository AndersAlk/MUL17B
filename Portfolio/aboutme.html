	<h2 id="caption">I can create anything with the paint tool, but that doesn't mean I'm a one-trick-pony:</h2>

	<p id="text-1">
		<b>I'm a person who values creativity and fun</b>, but that doesn't mean I don't know order and structure. I like to challenge myself, be ambitious and as a result, I grow quickly. <br> <br>
		
		I've always <b>admired the free handed art</b>, whether it's <b>drawing, painting or illustrations</b>. But since non of these put food on the table, I've decided to become a multimedia-designer. Thanks to this education, I've discovered a new found love for the programming languages and have put it into my spare passtimes. My art/design direction always try to mix contrasting themes. Say, you want something sexy and stylish, I'll enforce the eye-catch with creepy properties. I just love playing around.

	<b>The early years</b> I spent playing videogames and daydreaming. Just kidding, though it's not half wrong I did get a highschool education where I focused mostly on math and languages. Because the idea of working internationally doesn't scare me and I've always been quick to adopt a new language and it's local accent. I'm confident I'll fit in anywhere I end up
		</p>
	
	<p id="text-3">
		<b>These days</b>, I study multimediadesign at Copenhagen Business Academy in Lyngby, Denmark. 1st. semester of four in total. The one I'm at right now, focuses on learning the tools. Then comes, communication, interaction developement and finally, design and visualization. I'm confident I'll be more than ready by then!
		</p>
	
	<p id="text-4">
		I work best with feedback, <b>my greatest weakness</b> is, my lack of self-doubt. I'm easily impressed so I create the best work with others, to filter the good from the bad. Working alone is also easy for me, but a team effort makes everything so much better in the end. I don't have great expectations of my status, I'll be as happy working as an office-dweller as I would be as a leading art director. I just want to create something epic! Even if that means I only get to do it in my spare time.
