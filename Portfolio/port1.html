	<h4>
		What I did was
	</h4>
	<p>
		Removing the factory in the back and lighting up the sky and water which is all done strictly using the pen tool. But behind that is contrast filters and flares. The original picture (right) is much larger but I feel it wouldn't properly show the changes.

	<h4>
		About this project
	</h4>
	<p>
		Despite the heavy rain that day, I enjoyed the company of good friends and fellow students when we went out to take pictures of various bridges around the city of Copenhagen. Once done, we went home. The edit itself took approximately 2 hours, since the edits are on such a large scale and not too detailed. I did aim to make dramatic changes though.
	</p>
	
	<h4>
		In retrospect, I feel
	</h4>
	<p>
		the finished result is a bit fantasy looking. I think it works, but in the future I'd probably tone it down a notch on the extreme colours. The camoflage of the single pipe proved most challenging because its so tall and thin you cant hide it behind a cloud or other objects without it becoming too obvious. The properties sorrounding the removed objects have been affected too visibly as well.
